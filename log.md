# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues in UI logic of different data filtering, selecting and creating complex combinations of said data.
(Chains -> Segments -> Accounts).
Learned about some JS built in functions like flatMap, etc..

**Thoughts:** Having to support IE11 really sucks.
