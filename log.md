# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: August 30, 2018
**Today's progress**: Added a new field for orders to an eCommerce website to use a coupon code. Configured Sentry for 2 projects error reporting.
Continued improving the mobile responsiveness of an eCommerce website.

**Thought** Sentry is cool.

### Day 4: August 29, 2018
**Today's progress**: Continued learning react and changing the eCommerce platform to be more mobile responsive.

**Thoughts**: Learning React while developing vue isnt the best idea probably, but gotta do it. Work is using react and sidegigs are using vue.

### Day 3: August 28, 2018
**Today's progress**: Begun changes to a eCommerce website I made a few months ago to make it more mobile responsive.

**Thoughts:** Using Stylus+Pug in unison is a dream for webdevelopment.

### Day 2: August 27, 2018
**Today's progress**: Visited a cybersecurity related meetup, discussed ransomware and cryptocurrencies.
Not exactly coding but I'd consider it learning which is the goal for this challenge.
Learned React between meetings.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately the workday was filled with meetings and after work had a meetup so not much time for actual coding.

### Day 1: August 26, 2018
**Today's progress**: At work: Played with large and complex sql queries (And ORMs) to optimize load times. Looked at Coworkers React code, and compared it to other project structures, and learned about different react tips and tricks from youtube videos and developers I know from Discord channels.
At home: After staring at the Julia programming language for a while I finally decided to try it out and wrote my first code in Julia.
Interested in using Julia at work for data visualization and analysis. Currently played around with small data sets and tried visualizing using different built in functions and followed a youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLE0vz85Rqo&feature=youtu.be

**Thoughs:** Was good to start something new again. Working mostly in a preexisting environment and having to care about a million different things gets tiresome. Julia was a fresh thing.

### Day 0: August 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues in UI logic of different data filtering, selecting and creating complex combinations of said data.
(Chains -> Segments -> Accounts).
Learned about some JS built in functions like flatMap, etc..

**Thoughts:** Having to support IE11 really sucks.
