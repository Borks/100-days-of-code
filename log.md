# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: October 14, 2018
**Today's progress**: Even though just recently I picked up Julia for data processing at work (A new language) I now got introduced to ReasonML. As a JS developer, it's concepts intrigued me a lot. So today I'm checking Reason out.
TLDR Static type'ing, pattern matching, etc for JS, also compiles to assembly though. (Microcontrollers etc).
Took the responsive menu design live.

**Thoughts** At some point I really should focus more on one thing.

### Day 18: October 13, 2018
**Today's progress**:Took the responsive menu live to a staging environment for other devs to test, give feedback.
Further improved responsiveness on a few pages. Continued Udemy course.

### Day 17: October 12, 2018
**Today's progress**: Discovered why a new script in a legacy system did not produce the expected output. Due to data and datatype differences from newer systems. Improved script. Wrote a workaround to a classification system which relied on a different data structure as was in the legacy system.

### Day 16: October 11, 2018
**Today's progress**: Kept improving the responsiveness of the menu and the webshop.

**Thoughts** Really should have built in the responsiveness part on day 1. Adding it afterwards is a slight headache.
Not too hard but annoying.

### Day 15: October 10, 2018
**Today's progress**: Built a responsive sidemenu for a shop. Begun testing it on devices.

### Day 14: October 9, 2018
**Today's progress**:Continued the Udemy course. Did more reading for the json api standard.

### Day 13: October 8, 2018
**Today's progress**: Started following a Udemy course again for advanced JavaScript. I started this a while back but due to time constraints left unfinished. Improved routing in a vue project and did some error handling for it's laravel backend.

### Day 12: October 7, 2018
**Today's progress**: Now fixed frontend bugs thanks to the Vue integration to Sentry. Code quality improvements to JS code to follow standards.

**Thought**: Sentry still the best.

### Day 11: October  6, 2018
**Today's progress**: Fixed several backend bugs which were discovered thanks to the Sentry installation from a few days back. Mostly to do with error handling, incase missing variables. No showstoppers, simply edge cases.

**Thoughts**: Sentry the best.

### Day 10: October  5, 2018
**Today's progress**: Converted a few API endpoints to a better standard. At both work and at my personal projects.

**Thought**: Learned about JSON API standard from Pycon. I was aware of this structure before, but now I could connect a name to the standard. http://jsonapi.org/

### Day 9: October  4, 2018
**Today's progress**: Went to a Python conference called Pycon. This took the whole day.

**Thought** Met some old and new faces. Cool in general.

### Day 8: October  3, 2018
**Today's progress**: Updated a script for autodetection of a datastructure from data to support another datastructure. Implemented better error handling.

**Thought**: This was more of a bugfix then a new feature.

### Day 7: October 2, 2018
**Today's progress**: New version for the eCommerce platform. Added sentry for the Vue backend too. Learned about Sentry in general.

**Thought** Sentry for Vue provides literal tracebacks for ui actions. Amazing.

### Day 6: October 1, 2018
**Today's progress**: Continued studying Julia, and further improved mobile responsiveness for the eCommenrce platform.

**Thoughts** Id really like to use Julia in a real project. Currently just test-data and so forth.

### Day 5: August 30, 2018
**Today's progress**: Added a new field for orders to an eCommerce website to use a coupon code. Configured Sentry for 2 projects error reporting.
Continued improving the mobile responsiveness of an eCommerce website.

**Thoughts** Sentry is cool.

### Day 4: August 29, 2018
**Today's progress**: Continued learning react and changing the eCommerce platform to be more mobile responsive.

**Thoughts**: Learning React while developing vue isnt the best idea probably, but gotta do it. Work is using react and sidegigs are using vue.

### Day 3: August 28, 2018
**Today's progress**: Begun changes to a eCommerce website I made a few months ago to make it more mobile responsive.

**Thoughts:** Using Stylus+Pug in unison is a dream for webdevelopment.

### Day 2: August 27, 2018
**Today's progress**: Visited a cybersecurity related meetup, discussed ransomware and cryptocurrencies.
Not exactly coding but I'd consider it learning which is the goal for this challenge.
Learned React between meetings.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately the workday was filled with meetings and after work had a meetup so not much time for actual coding.

### Day 1: August 26, 2018
**Today's progress**: At work: Played with large and complex sql queries (And ORMs) to optimize load times. Looked at Coworkers React code, and compared it to other project structures, and learned about different react tips and tricks from youtube videos and developers I know from Discord channels.
At home: After staring at the Julia programming language for a while I finally decided to try it out and wrote my first code in Julia.
Interested in using Julia at work for data visualization and analysis. Currently played around with small data sets and tried visualizing using different built in functions and followed a youtube tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLE0vz85Rqo&feature=youtu.be

**Thoughs:** Was good to start something new again. Working mostly in a preexisting environment and having to care about a million different things gets tiresome. Julia was a fresh thing.

### Day 0: August 25, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fixed issues in UI logic of different data filtering, selecting and creating complex combinations of said data.
(Chains -> Segments -> Accounts).
Learned about some JS built in functions like flatMap, etc..

**Thoughts:** Having to support IE11 really sucks.
